Learning to drive in adverse weather conditions with Reinforcement Learning and CARLA

Exploration of the use of Reinforcement Learning in Autonomous vehicles with an aim towards teaching a vehicle to drive in multiple weather conditions from scratch.

Using [CARLA](https://carla.org/) and [gym-carla](https://github.com/cjy1992/gym-carla) (with some alterations) for the env.

Using [This Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.03765) along with [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01001) as a basis, with an eye towards further comparing the base model with more advanced models.
