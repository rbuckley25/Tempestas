Learning to drive in adverse weather conditions with Reinforcement Learning and CARLA

Exploration of the use of Reinforcement Learning in Autonomous vehicles with an aim towards teaching a vehicle to drive in multiple weather conditions from scratch.

Using (CARLA)[https://carla.org/] and (gym-carla)[https://github.com/cjy1992/gym-carla] (with some alterations) for the env.

Using (This Paper)[https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.03765] as a basis, along with (this paper)[https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01001].
